0) Write stubs for all listed:

1) RSS parser => objectToStore {
	(parsed data)
} => save as XML (initial RSS view?)

2) HTML => find article content (of at least one site) =>
write to some class (with interface{
	write
	read
	...something else?
	// All it needs to do is reconvert from HTML tags to some... 
	// Strange data structure? Lol, leave it to me))) 
})

3) Write content to pdf using interface from (2).
	It needs to use some library to work with PDF.
	Let Google help you to find it!  

4) show pdf
	There should be no problems... Or not?

5) GUI =
	show data
	select source
	
	... // A lot more.
	
6) Store data about or RSS feeds. (<XML?>)
	Add some more information (like likes) later. 
	It should store a lot of information actually. 
	But we need to figure out what we need first.

7) We need to connect to RSS's we need.
	But someone have to Google it, I suppose?
